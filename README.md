**Visualizing and Analyzing Performance Data with Songkick and Spotify**

This repo contains multiple files containing my work on this project. All code is in the 'showplotter' notebook. The "showplotter_with_analysis" notebook contains the code to run the different census tract and optimal path tests in the "Analysis" section.

I have various jupyter notebooks from an attempt at reorganzing my project to make it easier to work with, but it was not successful. I am keeping them here just in case. I converted these into .py files and I will update them when I feel I have made sufficient progress in my project. Hopefully, they can be used at a later time as I develop this project more.
